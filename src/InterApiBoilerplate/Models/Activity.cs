/// This is the intermediate API model that will be presented to and used by our application.
/// This could be:
/// 1. Front-end Javascript calling the intermediate API directly via an XHR.
/// 2. Back-end code on our web application calling the intermediate API.
/// This particular intermediate API model extrapolates and refines the data returned by the upstream API model (https://www.boredapi.com/).
/// Sometimes you will map the upstream API model to the intermediate API model 1:1 (in terms of properties).
/// In this case it's still important to build a dedicated intermediate API model (in case upstream API models change).
